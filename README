World Editor   {#world_editor_readme}
=======

## Overview

World Editor is a library that allows game developers who are using Fun Propulsion
Labs technologies for their games to lay out objects in the game world and
change their properties, all within the game itself.

## Features

This initial release of World Editor is focused on letting you perform certain core
tasks needed for editing a game world:

  * Fly around the game world with mouse and keyboard to look at the current
    layout.
  * Right-click to enter edit mode, which allows you to:
    * Click on entities to select them and view their properties.
    * Move, rotate, and scale entities in the game world by dragging with the
      mouse.
    * Edit properties of an entity via a text-based FlatBuffer editor.
    * Duplicate or delete entities in the game world.
  * Save in-game entities to a binary FlatBuffer file that can be loaded back into
    your game, and optionally to JSON files.

## Dependencies

World Editor depends on the following libraries:

  * [Entity System][] with the included component library
  * [FPLBase][]
  * [FlatBuffers][]
  * [FlatUI][]
  * [mathfu][]

This initial version of World Editor only supports desktop (Linux, Mac, Windows)
builds.

In order to use World Editor to lay out your scene, you must use Entity System
and its included component library for your in-game objects. Your objects should
use the following components:

  * MetaComponent (all objects must have this)
  * TransformComponent (for moving / rotating / scaling objects)
  * PhysicsComponent (optional, for selecting objects with the mouse)
  * RenderMeshComponent (optional, for highlighting the selected object)

You must also use an entity factory based on the component library's
EntityFactory, which uses a prototype-based system for instantiating entities,
and ensure that you have included the EditOptionsComponent and associated
data in your code.

Additionally, if you have any custom components, you must implement their
ExportRawData functions if you want the user to be able to edit an object's
properties from those components.

## Notes

For application on Google Play that integrate this tool, usage is tracked.
This tracking is done automatically using the embedded version string
(`kWorldEditorVersionString`), and helps us continue to optimize it.  Aside from
consuming a few extra bytes in your application binary, it shouldn't affect your
application at all.  We use this information to let us know if World Editor is useful
and if we should continue to invest in it. Since this is open source, you are
free to remove the version string but we would appreciate if you would leave it
in.
